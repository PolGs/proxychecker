# proxychecker

This is a web application that allows users to check a list of proxies for their validity. The user can paste a list of proxies into a form on the website, and the application will check each proxy against the Google homepage, returning a list of valid and invalid proxies. The application is built using the Flask framework and Python's built-in http.server module.
